#### Aperture
AKA f stop, values range from  ~2.2 – 22
higher the number, the smaller the aperture, because it is actually a **fraction**
<img width="845" alt="screen shot 2017-08-30 at 16 36 54" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26869008/29881154-b06e87d2-8da1-11e7-8f09-5900fc4e8c06.png">

Smaller aperture = less light, higher definition image
Larger aperture = more light, less defined image
Shallow depth of field = only subject in focus (background/foreground blurry) Used a lot for close-up shots of single subject
Large depth of field = all objects in focus, good for landscapes 

A = aperture priority 
You change aperture and camera will figure out the rest of the settings based on that 

#### Shutter speed
The time the sensor is exposed to the light
Long shutter speed = When light is limited, want to get motion blur effect (make sure camera is on tripod)
Short shutter speed = Sports events, wildlife (fast moving subjects) 

TV mode = shutter speed priority
You select shutter speed and camera decides best aperture (longer shutter speeds need high aperture, less light) 

#### ISO
Sensitivity of sensor to available light.
More ISO can make photo noisy/grainy.
Want to have it as low as possible. 

M = manual 
AF = Autofocus 

#### Sensors
Larger the sensor size, the better low light performance, image quality and artistic freedom 
Downsizes are = equipment is heavier, more expensive

Smaller sensor size = more difficult to create shallow depth of field e.g. iPhone camera, has that fake portrait mode
Boca - lights are bit and blurry
Have to get really close on iPhone to get that shallow depth effect

Entry level will have a **crop frame sensors**
Conventional 1.6 crop, image is effectively maginified 1.6 times
Benefits = smaller camera, better zoomed shots due to magnification
Cons = field of view narrowed, problem is that you can't get pro level lenses for crop sensors
Lenses have been designed for crop sensors to match focal length of full frame, wide angle
Using 85mm on crop sensor would seem very cropped


Bigger cameras will have **full frame sensors**
36mm x 24mm, equates to old historical value of 35mm film
Pros = Good in low light, can use better lenses, depth of field adjustments easier
Cons = Needs bigger lenses, more expensive

#### Lenses
**Zoom lens** - zooms in and out…
**Prime lens** – fixed to one focal length (can't zoom)

**Focal length** = maginification of the image, represented in mm
The higher the focal length, the higher the magnification

Human eye sees in 50mm, so 30-70mm is classed as **mid range lens**
Anything below 30mm is classed as a **wide angle lens** e.g. 15mm. The lower you go down, get more distorted the image gets around the side, it then starts to be called a **fish eye lens**

Once you get to 70mm - 1700mm = telephoto focal lens

Focal length alters perspective of an image
With wide angle you can make subject look large compared to background
As focal length increases you get background compression, so the subject stays the same size while background becomes compressed.
Higher focal length, blurrier background

Lower quality lenses, aperture will change when focal length is changed…

Higher quality lenses have **fixed apertures**
