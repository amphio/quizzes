#### Aperture
AKA f stop, values range from  ~2.2 – 22
higher the number, the smaller the aperture, because it is actually a **fraction**

Smaller aperture = less light, higher definition image
Larger aperture = more light, less defined image
Shallow depth of field = only subject in focus (background/foreground blurry) Used a lot for close-up shots of single subject
Large depth of field = all objects in focus, good for landscapes 

A = aperture priority 
You change aperture and camera will figure out the rest of the settings based on that 

#### Shutter speed
The time the sensor is exposed to the light
Long shutter speed = When light is limited, want to get motion blur effect (make sure camera is on tripod)
Short shutter speed = Sports events, wildlife (fast moving subjects) 

TV mode = shutter speed priority
You select shutter speed and camera decides best aperture (longer shutter speeds need high aperture, less light) 

#### ISO
Sensitivity of sensor to available light.
More ISO can make photo noisy/grainy
Want to have it as low as possible. 

M = manual
