#### Our camera – α7S II E-mount Camera with Full-Frame Sensor

`Resolution`
High resolution good to crop in

`Dynamic range`
Can really pick up the shadows

Battery life (still images)

Viewfinder type - electronic 

On the camera - M S A P 

**Mode P (Programmed Auto)**
The camera automatically adjusts aperture and shutter speed for optimal exposure, but the photographer can choose from different combinations of aperture and shutter speed that will produce the same exposure. This is known as flexible program.

**Mode S (Shutter-Priority Auto)**
The photographer chooses the shutter speed and the camera automatically adjusts aperture for optimal exposure.

**Mode A (Aperture-Priority Auto)**
The photographer chooses the aperture and the camera automatically adjusts shutter speed for optimal exposure.
Note: that in all three modes—P, S, and A—exposure is automatically adjusted for optimal results.

#### Aperture
AKA f stop, values range from  ~2.2 – 22
higher the number, the smaller the aperture, because it is actually a **fraction**
<img width="845" alt="screen shot 2017-08-30 at 16 36 54" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26869008/29881154-b06e87d2-8da1-11e7-8f09-5900fc4e8c06.png">

Smaller aperture = less light, higher definition image <br>
Larger aperture = more light, less defined image <br>
Shallow depth of field = only subject in focus (background/foreground blurry) Used a lot for close-up shots of single subject <br>
Large depth of field = all objects in focus, good for landscapes <br>

A = aperture priority <br>
You change aperture and camera will figure out the rest of the settings based on that <br>

#### Shutter speed
The time the sensor is exposed to the light <br>
Long shutter speed = When light is limited, want to get motion blur effect (make sure camera is on tripod) <br>
Short shutter speed = Sports events, wildlife (fast moving subjects) 

TV mode = shutter speed priority <br>
You select shutter speed and camera decides best aperture (longer shutter speeds need high aperture, less light) <br>

#### ISO
Sensitivity of sensor to available light. <br>
More ISO can make photo noisy/grainy.<br>
Want to have it as low as possible. 

M = manual 
AF = Autofocus 

#### Sensors
Larger the sensor size, the better low light performance, image quality and artistic freedom  <br>
Downsizes are = equipment is heavier, more expensive <br>

Smaller sensor size = more difficult to create shallow depth of field e.g. iPhone camera, has that fake portrait mode <br>
Boca - lights are bit and blurry <br>
Have to get really close on iPhone to get that shallow depth effect <br>

Entry level will have a **crop frame sensors** (DX) <br>
Conventional 1.6 crop, image is effectively maginified 1.6 times <br>
Benefits = smaller camera, better zoomed shots due to magnification <br>
Cons = field of view narrowed, problem is that you can't get pro level lenses for crop sensors <br>
Lenses have been designed for crop sensors to match focal length of full frame, wide angle <br>
Using 85mm on crop sensor would seem very cropped <br>


Bigger cameras will have **full frame sensors** (FX)<br>
36mm x 24mm, equates to old historical value of 35mm film <br>
Pros = Good in low light, can use better lenses, depth of field adjustments easier <br>
Cons = Needs bigger lenses, more expensive <br>

#### Lenses
**Zoom lens** - zooms in and out…
**Prime lens** – fixed to one focal length (can't zoom)

**Focal length** = maginification of the image, represented in mm
The higher the focal length, the higher the magnification

Human eye sees in 50mm, so 30-70mm is classed as **mid range lens** <br>
Anything below 30mm is classed as a **wide angle lens** e.g. 15mm. The lower you go down, get more distorted the image gets around the side, it then starts to be called a **fish eye lens**

Once you get to 70mm - 1700mm = telephoto focal lens <br>

Focal length alters perspective of an image <br>
With wide angle you can make subject look large compared to background <br>
As focal length increases you get background compression, so the subject stays the same size while background becomes compressed.<br>
Higher focal length, blurrier background <br>

Lower quality lenses, aperture will change when focal length is changed… <br>

Higher quality lenses have **fixed apertures**

Macro = close-up photograhy, lens can focus at short distances <br>
IF = Internal Focus, higher end lensesuse ultra sonic motors built into lens for processing to allow for high speed focussing  <br>
On Nikon AF-S = Focussing motors, USM (Ultra Sonic Motors) on Canon <br>
Entry level DSLRs may require Internal Focus lenses (as likely they don't have one inbuilt) <br>


Don't clean lens too much, has nano particles that you don't want to rub off <br>

Image Stabilisation VR (Vibration Reduction) on Nikon, IS (Image Stabilisation) on Canon

Zoom ring <br>
Aperture ring <br>

#### Prime lenses
1 Focal length <br>
Pros = smaller, shaper images, wide aperture, beautiful **Bokeh** <br>
Cons = no zoom <br>

Glass in the lens called **elements** <br>

Can have DX lenses and FX lenses <br>
FX cameras can also use DX lenses, however to avoid vignetting, the DX crop mode is automatically selected by the camera when a DX lens is attached.<br>
