### Lighting Department (film crew)
**Gaffer** - chief lighting technician, responsible for the execution (and sometimes the design) of the lighting plan for a production.
**Best boy** – gaffer’s assistant 
**Set lighting technicians** or **Electricians** – more assistants
**Lighting designer** – works with the director, choreographer, set designer, costume designer, and sound designer to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production
**Master electrician** - oversees the preparation, hanging, connection and focusing of staging lighting fixture



### Colour Temperature
Measured on the Kelvin scale 1000 - 10,000

**CRI (Colour Rendering Index)** – a measurement of how a light source reproduces colours compared to an ideal source e.g. the sun. Measured on scale 0-100

Daylight sun CRI = 100
Incandescent = 100
Fluorescent, LED and HMI (Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide) = <100, more efficient than incandescent halogen lamps

Florescent, LED & HMI produce *colour cast*
**Colour cast** = tint of a colour (often unwanted) that effects the whole image
Can use gels or filters to neutralise colour spikes 
Use minus green filter to balance fluorescent light
￼

Size of light dictates how harsh the shadows are. 
**Hard lights** = high contrast
**Soft lights** = low contrast

Incandescent light hard light as filament is small. Can be made into soft light by using a diffuser or bouncing light off something else. Using diffuser or bounce object as light source. 

Fluorescent lights are often softer as they are bigger.

LED often use lots of little lights.

### Light Types
Light output measured in **Lumens**

**Incandescent/Tungsten**
**Florescent**
**LED** ( Light-emitting diode)

**Footcandles**  -  A footcandle is defined as the illuminance on a one square foot surface from a uniform source of light.

### Lighting Setups
**Three point setup** - key light, fill light, hair light
Hair/back light - from behind. separates subject from background, makes edges pop

**Key light** – the strongest light, more dramatic look, more shadows
*High key* – low contrast 
*Low key* – high contrast

**Fill light** – could be same wattage, but further away, up to 50% as powerful as key light, controls contrast
**Hair light** – makes it more filmic, make sure not to point it right at the camera unless you want flare. Separates subject from the background, shows contours

Just hair light – quite dreamy
**Background light** – Light up the backdrop – make sure not to spill onto your subject. 45º angle, works well for green screen.


**Broad side/near side** – light is hitting broad side of subject’s face, with the face at an angle it will be the side that faces nearest the camera
￼
**Short side** – light on short side of subject’s face, the side away from camera
￼

**Side light** - dramatic
￼

**Rembrandt light** – position key light so you get triangle under the eye
￼
**Backlight** – 
￼
**Kicker or rim light** – Light curves a little round the face
￼
Cross light 

### Lighting Equipment/Accessories
Barn doors – open and close over lights to direct of cut off light.
Kino flo diva lights
Filters
Diffusion gel, makes the light softer, to reduce or diffuse shadows or glare
Flags – blocking out chunks of light
Scrims –
